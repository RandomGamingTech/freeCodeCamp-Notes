<!-- 1. We'll building a happy Flappy Penguin, and also we further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.

        the appropriate meta tags and a head, body and title element. Also we linked our stylesheet to the page.-->

<body>
    <!-- 4.- To create some scenery in the background, we'll add two mountains.
            - Above the penguin element, we added a div with a class of left-mountain -->
    <div class="left-mountain"></div>
    <!-- 5.- To give the effect of a mountain range, we added another mountain, by creating a new div immediately after .left-mountain, and gave the new dive the 
            class back-mountain. -->
    <div class="back-mountain"></div>
    <!-- 6.- To finish the background, we added a sun by creating a new div element immediately after the back-mountain element, and we gave it the class of sun -->
    <div class="sun"></div>
    <!-- 3.- Above the ground element we added a div with a class of penguin. This div will contain Flappy Penguin -->
    <!-- 4.- Our penguin will consist of two main sections: the head, and the body.
            Within penguin, we added two new div elements. The first with a class of penguin-head, and the second with a class of penguin-body. -->
    <div class="penguin">
        <div class="penguin-head">
                <!-- 7.- We started the penguin's face by adding two div elements within penguin-head, and gave them both a class of face. -->
